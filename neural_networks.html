    <h2>Introduction to Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>
        Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms modeled after the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, which work together to recognize patterns and make predictions. Each connection has an associated weight, which is adjusted during the training process to minimize the error of the network's predictions.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure of a Neural Network</h2>
    <p>
        A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the initial data, the hidden layers process the data through a series of transformations, and the output layer produces the final result.
    </p>

    <h2>How Neural Networks Learn</h2>
    <p>
        Neural networks learn by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons based on the error of the network's predictions. This process is typically done using a method called backpropagation, which involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and updating the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>
        Neural networks are used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships makes them powerful tools for solving various real-world problems.
