    <h2>Introduction to Classification</h2>
    <p>
        Classification is a supervised learning technique in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. There are various types of classifiers, each using different algorithms to achieve the classification task.

    <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
    <p>
        A Decision Tree is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one of the most intuitive and easy-to-interpret models in machine learning. The tree splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, making it easy to visualize and understand.

    <h2>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h2>
    <p>
        K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm where the class of a new observation is determined by the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the training set. The 'k' parameter is a positive integer that specifies the number of nearest neighbors to consider. KNN is straightforward and often effective, especially for smaller datasets.

    <h2>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h2>
    <p>
        Support Vector Machine is a powerful, supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. In higher dimensions, this hyperplane is known as a hyperplane. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is robust against overfitting, especially in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
