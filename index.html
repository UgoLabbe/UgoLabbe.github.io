    <h2>What is Classification?</h2>
    <p>
        Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. The model learns from a labeled dataset, where each training example is a pair consisting of an input object (usually a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).

    <h2>Common Classification Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Here are three common classification algorithms used in machine learning:</p>
    <h3>1. Decision Tree</h3>
    <p>
        A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The paths from the root to the leaf represent classification rules.

    <h3>2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h3>
    <p>
        KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm. The model assigns the class of a test instance based on the majority class among the k-nearest training instances in the feature space. It is simple but can be computationally intensive.

    <h3>3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3>
    <p>
        SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. It aims to maximize the margin between the different classes.
